# Super Tower Explorer
Super Tower Explorer is a procedurally-generated tower defense game. The object of the game is to protect the life heart by collecting resources and placing towers and walls for defense. Killing enemies rewards EXP that can be used to unlock new cells (map blocks). This uncovers more resources, but also more enemy spawn points.

# Controls and Gameplay
Start off by collecting resources on the starting tile. Use these to build a tower. Press the "Next Wave" button to begin a wave. Once all the enemies are killed and the wave is complete, you can collect resources and begin the next wave. Killing enough enemies to fill the EXP bar will unlock a new cell at the end of the wave.

Left click on resources to collect them.
Left click items in the build menu to start placing them, then left click on an empty tile to place.
Left click on towers to upgrade them.
Pan the camera was WASD.
Zoom in/out with the scroll wheel.
Change the game speed with the 1, 2, and 3 keys.
